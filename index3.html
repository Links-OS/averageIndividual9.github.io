<center><h2 style="color:white;">What we do</h2></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">Shiba Productions is a one person production company. I create digital media including Games, and Music for entertainment. Founded in 2023 by a beginning developer. Our current main focus is establishing a community for project support and motivation. Understandably any project started will take a long period to be completed due to the fact that there is only one sound producer, one artist, and one developer, all of which are me. So please be patient. </p></center>
<center><h2 style="color:white;">Our current projects</h2></center>
<center><p style="color:white;">Currently we are working on a prototype for a game, the name is Boomerang Explorer. The point of the game will be to explore for as long as you can without dying. You can check out the prototype at <a href="https://shiba-productions.itch.io/boomerang-explorer" target="_blank">itch.io</a> or at the offical page for <a href="Boomerang.html" target="_blank">Boomerang Explorer</a>.</p></center>
